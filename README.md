## My process

### Built with

- **Semantic HTML5** - Focused on landmark elements (`<main>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`).
- **CSS Custom Properties** - Used for consistent color palettes and typography.
- **Flexbox** - Utilized for both the global layout (centering) and component-level layout (vertical stacking).
- **Mobile-first workflow** - Ensured responsiveness down to 320px screen width.
- **Local Fonts (@font-face)** - Implemented "Inter" font locally for better performance and offline support.

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my understanding of **CSS Specificity** and **Case Sensitivity**. One major learning moment was debugging why a hover state didn't trigger because of a case mismatch in class names (`.social-Links` vs `.social-links`).

I also practiced using **Semantic HTML** to ensure screen readers can easily navigate the list of social links.
